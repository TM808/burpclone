# Remote Access Tool

## Overview
This tool provides remote access capabilities for system administration and troubleshooting purposes.

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Edit the `remote_access.sh` file to configure your specific connection details:
   - Set `REMOTE_HOST` to your server's IP address
   - Set `REMOTE_PORT` to your desired port number (default: 4444)

### On the server side
Before executing the script, set up a listener on your server:

```bash
nc -lvp 4444
```

Replace `4444` with the port you configured in the script.

### Executing the script
Run the script on the target system:

```bash
./remote_access.sh
```

The script will attempt to establish a connection back to your server using various methods available on the system.

## Security Notice
This tool should only be used for legitimate system administration purposes on systems you own or have explicit permission to access. Unauthorized use may violate applicable laws.

## Troubleshooting
If the connection fails:
1. Verify that the IP address and port are correct
2. Ensure your listener is running on the server
3. Check for any firewall restrictions that might block the connection
